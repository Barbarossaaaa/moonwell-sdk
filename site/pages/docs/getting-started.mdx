# Getting Started [Get started with moonwell sdk in just a few lines of code.]

## Overview



## Installation

<InstallCommandTabs />

## Quick Start

### 1. Set up your Networks & RPC urls

Firstly, set up your [Networks](/docs/networks/introduction) & [RPC urls](/docs/rpc/introduction).

```ts twoslash
import { createMoonwellClient } from '@moonwell-fi/moonwell-sdk';

const moonwellClient = createMoonwellClient({ // [!code focus]
  networks: { // [!code focus]
    base: { // [!code focus]
      rpcUrls: ["https://base.llamarpc.com"], // [!code focus]
    }, // [!code focus]
    optimism: { // [!code focus]
      rpcUrls: ["https://optimism.llamarpc.com"], // [!code focus]
    }, // [!code focus]
  }, // [!code focus]
}); // [!code focus]
```

:::info
In a production app, it is highly recommended to pass through your authenticated RPC provider URL (Alchemy, Infura, Ankr, etc). If no URL is provided, moonwell sdk will default to a public RPC provider. [Read more](/docs/clients/transports/http#usage).

### 2. Consume Actions

Now that you have a Client set up, you can now interact with Base and consume [Actions](/docs/actions/public/introduction)!

```ts twoslash 
// [!include ~/snippets/moonClient.ts]

const markets = await moonwellClient.getMarkets(); // [!code focus]
```

# Getting Started [Integrate Moonwell SDK with just a few lines of code]

## Overview

Moonwell SDK is a TypeScript library that provides a simple and intuitive way to interact with Moonwell's lending protocol. It offers a comprehensive set of tools for querying market data across multiple networks including Base and Optimism.

Key features:
- ðŸ”Œ Easy network configuration
- ðŸ“Š Real-time market data access
- ðŸ“± Multi-network support

## Installation

<InstallCommandTabs />

## Quick Start

### 1. Set up your Networks & RPC urls

```ts twoslash
import { createMoonwellClient } from '@moonwell-fi/moonwell-sdk';

const moonwellClient = createMoonwellClient({ // [!code focus]
  networks: { // [!code focus]
    base: { // [!code focus]
      rpcUrls: ["https://base.llamarpc.com"], // [!code focus]
    }, // [!code focus]
    optimism: { // [!code focus]
      rpcUrls: ["https://optimism.llamarpc.com"], // [!code focus]
    }, // [!code focus]
  }, // [!code focus]
}); // [!code focus]
```

:::info
In a production app, it is highly recommended to pass through your authenticated RPC provider URL (Alchemy, Infura, Ankr, etc). If no URL is provided, moonwell-sdk will default to a public RPC provider.
:::

### 2. Consume Actions

Now that you have a Client set up, you can now interact with Base and consume [Actions](/docs/actions/core/getMarkets)!

```ts twoslash 
// [!include ~/snippets/moonClient.ts]

const markets = await moonwellClient.getMarkets(); // [!code focus]
```
